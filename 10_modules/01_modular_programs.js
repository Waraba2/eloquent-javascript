// The phrase “big ball of mud” is often used for such large, structureless programs. Everything 
// sticks together, and when you try to pick out a piece, the whole thing comes apart, and you only
// succeed in making a mess.
// Modules are an attempt to avoid these problems. A module is a piece of program that specifies 
// which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides for other modules to use 
// (its interface).
