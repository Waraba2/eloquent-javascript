// Summary
// Modules provide structure to bigger programs by separating the code into pieces with clear 
// interfaces and dependencies. The interface is the part of the module thatâ€™s visible to other 
// modules, and the dependencies are the other modules it makes use of.
//
// Because JavaScript historically did not provide a module system, the CommonJS system was built 
// on top of it. Then at some point it did get a built-in system, which now coexists uneasily with 
// the CommonJS system.
//
// A package is a chunk of code that can be distributed on its own. NPM is a repository of 
// JavaScript packages. You can download all kinds of useful (and useless) packages from it.
