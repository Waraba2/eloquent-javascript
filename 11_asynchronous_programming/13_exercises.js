// 1. Quiet Times:
// There’s a security camera near Carla’s lab that’s activated by a motion sensor. It is connected
// to the network and starts sending out a video stream when it is active. Because she’d rather not
// be discovered, Carla has set up a system that notices this kind of wireless network traffic and
// turns on a light in her lair whenever there is activity outside, so she knows when to keep quiet.
//
// She’s also been logging the times at which the camera is tripped for a while and wants to use
// this information to visualize which times, in an average week, tend to be quiet, and which tend
// to be busy. The log is stored in files holding one time stamp number (as returned by Date.now())
// per line.
//
// 1695709940692
// 1695701068331
// 1695701189163
// The "camera_logs.txt" file holds a list of log files. Write an asynchronous function
// activityTable(day) that for a given day of the week returns an array of 24 numbers, one for each
// hour of the day, that hold the number of camera network traffic observations seen in that hour
// of the day. Days are identified by number using the system used by Date.getDay, where Sunday is
// 0 and Saturday is 6.
//
// The activityGraph function, provided by the sandbox, summarizes such a table into a string.
//
// To read the files, use the textFile function defined earlier—given a filename, it returns a
// promise that resolves to the file’s content. Remember that new Date(timestamp) creates a Date
// object for that time, which has getDay and getHours methods returning the day of the week and
// the hour of the day.
//
// Both types of files—the list of log files and the log files themselves—have each piece of data
// on its own line, separated by newline ("\n") characters.

// 2. Real Promises:
// Rewrite the function from the previous exercise without async/await, using plain Promise methods.
//
// In this style, using Promise.all will be more convenient than trying to model a loop over the
// log files. In the async function, just using await in a loop is simpler. If reading a file takes
// some time, which of these two approaches will take the least time to run?

// If one of the files listed in the file list has a typo, and reading it fails, how does that
// failure end up in the Promise object that your function returns?

// 3. Building Promise.all:
// As we saw, given an array of promises, Promise.all returns a promise that waits for all of the
// promises in the array to finish. It then succeeds, yielding an array of result values. If a
// promise in the array fails, the promise returned by all fails too, passing on the failure reason
// from the failing promise.

// Implement something like this yourself as a regular function called Promise_all.
//
// Remember that after a promise has succeeded or failed, it can’t succeed or fail again, and
// further calls to the functions that resolve it are ignored. This can simplify the way you handle
// failure of your promise.
function Promise_all(promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Your code here.
  });
}

// Test code.
Promise_all([]).then((array) => {
  console.log("This should be []:", array);
});
function soon(val) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(val), Math.random() * 500);
  });
}
Promise_all([soon(1), soon(2), soon(3)]).then((array) => {
  console.log("This should be [1, 2, 3]:", array);
});
Promise_all([soon(1), Promise.reject("X"), soon(3)])
  .then((array) => {
    console.log("We should not get here");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error != "X") {
      console.log("Unexpected failure:", error);
    }
  });
