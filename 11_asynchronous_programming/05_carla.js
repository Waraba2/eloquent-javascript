// It’s a sunny day in Berlin. The runway of the old, decommissioned airport is teeming with
// cyclists and inline skaters. In the grass near a garbage container a flock of crows noisily
// mills about, trying to convince a group of tourists to part with their sandwiches.
//
// One of the crows stands out—a large scruffy female with a few white feathers in her right wing.
//She is baiting people with a skill and confidence that suggest she’s been doing this for a long
//time. When an elderly man is distracted by the antics of another crow, she casually swoops in,
//snatches his half-eaten bun from his hand, and sails away.
//
// Contrary to the rest of the group, who look like they are happy to spend the day goofing around
// here, the large crow looks purposeful. Carrying her loot, she flies straight towards the roof of
// the hangar building, disappearing into an air vent.
//
// Inside the building, you can hear an odd tapping sound—soft, but persistent. It comes from a
// narrow space under the roof of an unfinished stairwell. The crow is sitting there, surrounded
// by her stolen snacks, half a dozen smartphones (several of which are turned on), and a mess of
// cables. She rapidly taps the screen of one of the phones with her beak. Words are appearing on
// it. If you didn’t know better, you’d think she was typing.
//
// This crow is known to her peers as “cāāw-krö”. But since those sounds are poorly suited for
// human vocal chords, we’ll refer to her as Carla.
//
// Carla is a somewhat peculiar crow. In her youth, she was fascinated by human language,
// eavesdropping on people until she had a good grasp of what they were saying. Later in life, her
// interest shifted to human technology, and she started stealing phones to study them. Her current
// project is learning to program. The text she is typing in her hidden lab is, in fact, a piece of
// asynchronous JavaScript code.
