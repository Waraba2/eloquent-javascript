// Summary
// Asynchronous programming makes it possible to express waiting for long-running actions without
// freezing the whole program. JavaScript environments typically implement this style of
// programming using callbacks, functions that are called when the actions complete. An event loop
// schedules such callbacks to be called when appropriate, one after the other, so that their
// execution does not overlap.
//
// Programming asynchronously is made easier by promises, objects that represent actions that might
// complete in the future, and async functions, which allow you to write an asynchronous program as
// if it were synchronous.
